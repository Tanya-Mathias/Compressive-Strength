# Compressive-Strength
A simple project to determine the compressive strength of concrete using python and Django.
# Introduction
Concrete is a material that is most frequently used in building. Concrete consists of a mixture of materials, including cement, water, coarse aggregates and others. The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength. Compressive strength is measured by crushing a concrete cube or a cylinder until it starts cracking and is completely crushed. The pressure at which the concrete cube or a cylinder starts cracking and eventually crushes is called the Concrete compressive strength and is measured in megapascals (MPa). It takes a period of 28 days to test this using multiple samples.
# Why predict Compressive Strength?
* Predicting concrete strength can be helpful in assessing the deterioration of concrete structures and increasing their safety (quality control, acceptance
of concrete, even scheduling construction operations).
* It can generate business value.
* It leads to optimization of the materials used to form the concrete in order to decrease the costs of construction and at the same time meet the workability requirement of concrete.
* It can increase the safety of the structure by measuring strength and prevents expenses in case of emergency.
